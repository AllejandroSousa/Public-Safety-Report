## Real data analyzed for the Technology and Artificial Intelligence League (TAIL) of UFPB trainees project
The analyzed data comes from the state of SÃ£o Paulo, covering the period from 2006 to 2016.
A note that the data is real, but significantly reduced due to resource constraints in handling the massive volume of the total data - that can be found in https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/inquisitivecrow/crime-data-in-brazil.
